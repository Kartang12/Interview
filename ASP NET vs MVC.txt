You must remember how you differentiate between a normal MVC Controller and a Web API Controller...

WebAPI Controllers enforces this annotation [ApiController] and must inherits from ControllerBase:

[ApiController]
public class PeopleController : ControllerBase {
   //Your API methods here
}

A normal MVC Controller only inherits from Controller base class:


public class PeopleController : Controller {
   //Your Action methods here...
}

Those already create configuration for your APP which becomes easier for you Hosting environment to know what is going and what to return when.
